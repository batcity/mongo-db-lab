# MongoDB Learning Lab (MongoDB-first Structure)

This repo is a **MongoDB-focused learning lab**.  

## Quickstart

You can bootstrap the entire environment with the included setup script by running:

```
. ./setup.sh
```

This will:
- start the MongoDB single-node replica set via Docker
- create a Python virtual environment
- install dependencies

Note: This setup uses a **single-node replica set** so transactions & change streams work locally.

## Labs

- document_modeling
- indexing
- aggregation
- sharding
- replication
- transactions
- change_streams
- concurrency
- performance
- admin
